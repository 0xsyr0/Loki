# üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Loki Command & Control
Loki is a stage-1 command and control (C2) framework written in Node.js, built to script-jack vulnerable Electron apps _[MITRE ATT&CK T1218.015](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/015/)_. Developed for red team operations, Loki enables evasion of security software and bypasses application controls by exploiting trusted, signed Electron apps.

Script-jacking hijacks the execution flow of an Electron app by modifying JavaScript files loaded in at runtime with arbitrary Node.js code. This technique can be leveraged to:
- __Backdoor the Electron app__
- __Hollow out the Electron app__
- Chain execution to another process

_While several tools already address leveraging script-jacking to chain execution to another process, Loki is the first to enable backdooring and hollowing of signed Electron apps without invalidating their code signing signature._

## Features & Details
- Azure Storage Blob C2 channel
  - SAS Token to protect C2 storage account
- AES encrypted C2 messages
- Proxy-aware agent
  - Uses Chromium renderer child processes for agent, shellcode execution, and assembly fork-n-run style execution -- inherits proxy-aware capabilities of Chromium.
- Teamserver-less
  - Unlike traditional C2's where agents send messages to a Teamserver, there is no Teamserver
  - The GUI client & agents both checkin to the same data-store
- Hidden exection -- runs in the background

### Commands
_All agent commands are written in native Node.JS and do not require additional dependencies or library load events. With the exception of the `scexec` and `assembly` commands which do a library load on `keytar.node` and `assembly.node`_
- All commands accept paths using `/`, `\` in paths will not work.

| Command     | Description                                                                |

| `set`       | Set the Node load paths for assembly node and scexec nodes                 |  

#### `Set` - Loading Nodes from Application Control Exclusion Paths
- If there are application control rules preventing library loads for the node files you can use the `set` command to change the load paths for `assembly.node` and `scexec.node`. 
- By using `ls`, `cat`, `cp` and `mv` you may be able to enumerate the application control rules to discover a writable directory that is an exclusion. 
- With this you can put the node files in the exclusion directory and use the `set` command to change their load path to the exclusion directory to bypass the application control.

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Deploy Illusions 
First you need to identify a vulnerable Electron application which does not do ASAR security integrity checks such as `Microsoft Teams`. Newer applications may have integrity checks preventing backdooring. Older versions of the target app are more likely to be vulnerable.

### Simple Instructions
_You don't need to compile the agent when backdooring Electron apps. Just replace the contents of `{ELECTRONAPP}/resources/app/` with the Loki agent files._

### Detailed Instructions
#### Step 1 : Create Azure Storage Blob Account and get SAS Token
- [Create Azure Storage Account via Azure Portal](./docs/azure/create-storage-account-portal.md)
- [Create Azure Storage Account via Azure CLI](./docs/azure/create-storage-account-sas-azurecli.md)
#### Step 2 : Create Obfuscated Loki Payload
- Clone this repo and `cd` into it
- Install Node.JS
- Install `javascript-obfuscator` module
```
npm install --save-dev javascript-obfuscator
```
- Run `obfuscateAgent.js` script to create a Loki payload with your Storage Account info
```
bobby$ node obfuscateAgent.js 
[+] Provide Azure storage account information:
        - Enter Storage Account  : 7f7584ty218ba5dba778.blob.core.windows.net
        - Enter SAS Token        : se=2025-05-28T23%3A14%3A48Z&sp=rwdlac&spr=https&sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sig=5MXQzJ6FDZK8yYiBSgJ6FDZKgQzJMXBSgg6qE4ydrJ6FDZKSgg%3D

[+] Configuration:
        - Storage Account : 7f7584ty218ba5dba778.blob.core.windows.net
        - SAS Token       : se=2025-05-28T23%3A14%3A48Z&sp=rwdlac&spr=https&sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sig=5MXQzJ6FDZK8yYiBSgJ6FDZKgQzJMXBSgg6qE4ydrJ6FDZKSgg%3D
        - Meta Container  : mllyi2zjmafjm

[+] Updated /Users/bobby/apr2/LokiC2/config.js with storage configuration. 
 - Enter into the Loki Client UI
        Loki Client > Configuration

[+] Modifying PE binaries to have new hashes...
        - Payload assembly.node hash : e9d126407264821d3c2d324da0e2d1bc13cbc53e7c56340fe12b07f69b707f02
        - Payload keytar.node   hash : 292c14ffebd6cae3df99d9fbee525e29a5a704f076b82207eb3e650de45b075d

[+] Payload ready!
         - Obfuscated payload in the ./app directory
```
#### Step 3 : Backdoor Electron Application
- Your obfuscated Loki payload is output to `./app/`
- Change directory to the `{ELECTRONAPP}/resources/`  
- Delete everything
- Copy the Loki `./app/` folder to `{ELECTRONAPP}/resources/app/`
- Click the Electron PE file and make sure Loki works

#### Step 4 : Configure Loki Client
- Launch the Loki GUI client
- From the menubar click `Loki Client > Configuration` to open the Settings window
- Enter in your Storage Account details and click `Save`
  
  ![](./docs/images/lokisettings.png)
- The agent should now render in the dashboard
- Click the agent from the dashboard table to open the agent window
- Test to ensure Loki works properly


## Backdooring Electron Apps and Keeping the real Application Working as Normal
The most straightforward way to use Loki is to replace the files in `{ELECTRONAPP}/resources/app/` with the Loki files. This hollows out the app, meaning the app won't function normally -- Loki replaced its functionality.  

If you really want to keep the Electron application running and have it also deploy Loki in the background all hope is not lost! [John Hammond](https://x.com/_JohnHammond) and I figured out a way to keep the real Electron application running. We've added the file you will need to `/loki/proxyapp/init.js` in this repo.

It is currently setup to work for Cursor, discovered to be vulnerable by [John Hammond](https://x.com/_JohnHammond). 

For doing this you will need to:
- Download the Cursor app
- Paste all Loki files except `package.json` to `cursor/resources/app/`
  - Don't replace the real `package.json`
- Copy `/loki/proxyapp/init.js` to `cursor/resources/app/`
- Modify contents of `cursor/resources/app/package.json` to:
  - set `"main":"init.js",`
  - delete `"type":"module",`
  - delete `"private":true,`

### How this works
- With these changes `Cursor.exe` will load in `init.js` on click / execution
- `init.js` reads in `package.json`
- `init.js` changes `"main":"init.js",` -> `"main":"main.js",`
  - `main.js` is Loki
- `init.js` spawns and disowns a new `Cursor.exe` which points to Loki
- __Loki is spawned in the background__
- `init.js` reads in `package.json` again
- `init.js` changes `"main":"main.js",` -> `"main":"./out/main.js",`
  - `./out/main.js"` is the real Cursor application
- `init.js` spawns and disowns a new `Cursor.exe` which points to the real Cursor
- __Real Cursor app is spawned, visible and operates as normal__
- When Cursor is exited by the user:
  - `init.js` catches the exit
  - `init.js` reads in `package.json` for a third time
  - `init.js` changes `"main":"./out/main.js",` -> `"main":"init.js",`

This way the app is persistently backdoored and operates as normal. If the cursor app is exited loki will continue to run in the background.

### Future
I'll make a script to automate this in the future.

## Compilation Guides
These are the compile instructions for building the agents & clients. The instructions cover multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. It is recommended to compile the client on the target platform and architecture.

### Client
- [Windows](./docs/compile/client/windows.md)
- [macOS](./docs/compile/client/macos.md)
- [Linux](./docs/compile/client/linux.md)

### Agents
**If you are backdooring an Electron application then you don't need to compile agents.**  

I do not recommend compiling the agent and using it for operations. Agent compile instructions are for development.

- [Linux](./docs/compile/agent/linux.md)
- [macOS](./docs/compile/agent/macos.md)

## Detection Guidance
- Review the information provided by MITRE for more details, examples, and information about this TTP :
  -  [MITRE ATT&CK T1218.015: Electron Applications](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/015/)
- Execution of an electron app from a abnormal directory such as `~/Downloads/Teams/Teams.exe`
- Electron apps beaconing to an Azure Storage Blob `*.blob.core.windows.net`
- SAS token usage in network traffic
- Electron apps spawning child processes such as `netstat.exe` or `whoami.exe`
- A directory with the name in the Loki `package.json` will be created in `~/AppData/Roaming/{NAME}` when the Loki JavaScript executes in the Electron process.
- This [LOLBAS Teams](https://lolbas-project.github.io/lolbas/OtherMSBinaries/Teams/) entry covers detections for Electron application backdooring. The detection information has been copied below.  
- IOC: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Teams\current\app` directory created
- IOC: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Teams\current\app.asar` file created/modified by non-Teams installer/updater
- [SIGMA rule](https://github.com/4y45u45c4/SIGMA/blob/main/loki_c2_channel_established_from_electron_app.yaml) to detect established Loki C2 from electron app
- [SIGMA rule](https://github.com/4y45u45c4/SIGMA/blob/main/hijack_of_electron_app_to_load_C2_framework.yaml) to detect hijacking of Electron's app folder (Teams, VS Code, RingCentral, Postman) to load C2 framework
